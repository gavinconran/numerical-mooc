We know explicit schemes have stability constraints that might make them impractical in some cases, due to requiring a very small time step. Implicit schemes are unconditionally stable, offering the advantage of larger time steps; in [notebook 2](https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/04_spreadout/04_02_Heat_Equation_1D_Implicit.ipynb), we look at the 1D implicit solution of diffusion. Already, that was quite a lot of work: setting up a matrix of coefficients and a right-hand-side vector, while taking care of the boundary conditions, and then solving the linear system. And now, we want to do implicit schemes in 2D—are you ready for this challenge?"

For example, `i=nx-2, j=2`, which is in row `row_number = 2*nx-5`, is next to a Neumann boundary condition: we have to substract one out of the main diagonal (`A[2*nx-5,2*nx-5]-=1`), and put a zero in the next column (`A[2*nx-5,2*nx-4]=0`).
